This is the repository where people can post their typeset solutions, as assigned by the professor. 

For a quick introduction on how to use git, give this link a try:
https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1

If you prefer to use a GUI to interact with Github, I personally would recommend SourceTree:
